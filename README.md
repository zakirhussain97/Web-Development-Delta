DELTA – Full Stack Web Development
DELTA is a project-based full-stack web development roadmap and codebase that takes you from the basics of the web to building, deploying, and scaling production-ready applications.

What you will learn
Modern frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flexbox, Grid, responsiveness, Bootstrap, Tailwind CLI, React (components, props, state, hooks, custom hooks), and Material UI.
JavaScript mastery: DOM & events, event bubbling/delegation, async JS (promises, async/await), Ajax with fetch, Axios, and API integration.
Backend engineering: Node.js, Express, npm, REST APIs, routing, cookies, sessions, middlewares, MVC, validations, error handling, and authentication/authorisation.
Data layer: Working with SQL and NoSQL, MongoDB deep dive, Mongo relationships, and integrating data into real projects.[web:58][web:59]
Production skills: Git & GitHub, EJS templating, Cloudinary, Mapbox (geocoding and maps), deployment with Render, plus AWS deployment, socket.io, WebRTC, and unit testing with Jest.
